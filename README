Hivency technical test


##### INTRO #####

Bzzzz !!! Welcome to the hive !

Here in Hivency we have some famous bees. They all use Instagram or Youtube.
We also have many kind of Honey. We give some Honey to our bees and in exhange they do a Post on
youtube or instagram to promote our tasty Honey.

Our Bee can choose between many kind of Honey.
For that they do it online on a dedicated store where all the Honeys are FREE !
For each kind of Honey we, at Hivency, create a Campaign with some condition.
The red-honey is only for the bee famous on Youtube.
The pink-honey is only for the bee famous on Instgram.
The dark-honey is only for the bee famous on Youtube tha are at least 18 year old


##### SPECIFICATION #####

We have Users who can have many networks (Instagram(s) or/and youtube(s))

You have to implement the model Campaign. A campaign have some criterias.

Here is the list of criteria you have to implement, but feel free to add some:
 - Criteria Network, the network the campaign is in (youtube or instagram)
 - Criteria Views, the number of views the network must have (at least)
 - Criteria Like, the number of views the network must have (at least)
 - Criteria Subscribers, the number of views the network must have (at least)
 - Criteria Age, the age the user must have (Beetween 18 / 45 for exemple)
 - Criteria Country, the country the user must live in.

One campaign must have at least the Network criteria, the others are optional.

You must implement the endpoint Store.

The endpoint must return a list of Campaign matched by a specific user (the one loged in).

For example: 

Campaign 1 : Criteria Network = Youtube, Criteria subscribers = 5_000
Campaign 2 : Criteria Network = Youtube, Criteria subscribers = 10_000
Campaign 3 : Criteria Network = Instagram

User1 => Network1 = Instagram
         Network2 = Youtube, subscribers = 7_000

The store will return (When loged as User1) the campaigns 1 and 3

The views column must be always nil for Instagram, because Instagram has no views metrics.
So no one can match a campaign with criteria network = Instgram and criteria views.


Feel free to add unit test.
You can use any gems.
You can do an API or render HTML as you want.

The test is willingly blurry so you can take your time to structure your code, have quality commit versioning and expand the technical test with other features.

good luck, bzzzzz ;)
